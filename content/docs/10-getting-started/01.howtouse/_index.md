## How to use

Using SVG Stencils is easy.

- Place your browser window next to your design app.
- Open [svg-stencils.github.io](https://svg-stencils.github.io) in the browser.
- Select a stencil with components you'd like to use.
- Drag components from your browser directly into the canvas of your design app. The components are in SVG format, so your can change texts, element sizes etc.
- If for some reason you cannot drag and drop, right click the component and choose copy SVG.
