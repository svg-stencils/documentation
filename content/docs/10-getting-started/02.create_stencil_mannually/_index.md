## How to create a stencil library manually

A minimal directory structure of a stencil is:

```
./stencil-components.json
./stencil-meta.json
./component1.svg
./component2.svg
./component3.svg
```

Use [other published stencils](https://github.com/svg-stencils/svg-stencils.github.io/blob/main/public/stencils.json) as example.
