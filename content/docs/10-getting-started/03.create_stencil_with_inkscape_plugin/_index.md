## How to create a stencil library with the SVG Stencil Inkscape Extension

We created an [Inkscape
Extension](https://github.com/svg-stencils/inkscape-svg_stencil_export) which
helps with the creations of new stencils.

1. Install the extension
2. Open your svg file with reusable components
3. Move all single components to a separate layer
4. Move all stuff you don not want to share to a hidden layer
5. Open de extension from the extension menu
6. Choose an newly created output directory as export path
6. Fill in all fields on the first 3 tabs.
7. You can use this extension multiple times, but the first time, make sure to check `write stencil-components.json` and `write -stencil-meta.json`
